# fight-covid-19
So, I am not a doctor, but in this pandemic situation, I would like to do my bit.
I came up with a small approach to fight this covid 19, specially this lockdown situation.

In this weird situation, everyone is sitting home and may need some help from outside, or may want to help in some way.
I am currently working on a website where, there will be two options
 
1. I NEED HELP
2. I CAN HELP

The goal of this website is (CAN HELP) to find volunteer in your nearby area, or (NEED HELP) to find people who requires urgent attention.

*Help should only be limited to medical needs, basic needs or an urgent attention.*

I am requesting you all to give me suggessions on what kind of help a person may need to update my database. Also, what other things, features, functionality you may want to see in website. I would like to finish this as soon as possible. So need your sugessions and feedback.
